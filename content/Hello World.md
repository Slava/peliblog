### Hello world!

Some [links](http://google.com) go here.

And this is the first post in the `PeliBlog`, a thing generated by *pelican* here is some code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
  printf("%s\n", "Hello world!"); // so original!
  return 0;
}
```

Did you know that $2*2=4$?

```python
# calculates the factorial
def factorial(n):
  return 1 if n < 2 else n * factorial(n - 1)
```

```javascript
(function () {
  console.log(this);
})();
```

$$ \frac{3}{5} = \alpha * \beta $$
